# Welcome to My Mathematics, Statistics, and Data Science Journey!

I'm a passionate about ANYTHING related to data and numbers! My journey in this exciting field has been fueled by my fascination with mathematics and statistics, which I believe form the foundation of these technologies. I'm constantly exploring new ways to unlock insights from data and create intelligent systems that can make a positive impact on the world.

## My Projects

Here are some of my notable projects:

- [**Clustering Spotify Podcasts with NLP-Driven Insights**](https://github.com/Stochastic1017/Spotify-Podcast-Clustering)
  - Scraped $\approx$ *284,481* episode details from *818* podcasts using Selenium and Spotify API pipeline.
  - Preprocessed and tokenized podcast descriptions with **NLTK**, including lemmatization and stopword removal.
  - Developed metrics to quantify directional, overlap, diversity similarities, and engineered recommendation system.
  - Deployed a **Dash** app for podcast clustering and personalized recommendations.
    
- [**Predicting Flight Delays and Cancellations: An Integrated Analysis of Airport Data and Weather Data**](https://github.com/Stochastic1017/Airport-Weather-Prediction)
    - Automated scraping of 23 GB airport and 30 GB weather data using **Selenium**.
    - Utilized reverse geocoding, Haversine-based, and UTC-normalized alignments to join datasets.
    - Trained random forest models, achieving $\approx$ *25* min test RMSE for delays and $\approx$ *98%* test accuracy for cancellations.
    - Developed scalable workflows on Google Cloud, and deployed interactive web-app using **Dash**.
      
- [**Modeling and Forecasting Walmart Stock Prices: A Comparative Analysis of ARMA and GARCH Approaches**](https://github.com/Stochastic1017/Walmart-Stock-Forecasting)
    - Leveraged ARIMA and GARCH models using **tseries** and **fGarch** in **R** to analyze Walmart stock price volatility.
    -  Developed and validated ensemble models through residual diagnostics and forecast evaluation.
    -  Achieved RMSE of $\approx$ \$ 0.01 for log-returns and $\approx$ \$ 1.17 for closing prices on unseen 10-day forecast and actual
prices.
  
- [**Statistical Modeling and Deployment of Body Fat Percentage Prediction System**](https://github.com/Stochastic1017/Body-Fat-Study)
  - Implemented anomaly detection and imputation strategy using prior body fat estimation model.
  - Constructed Stepwise regression model with Goodness of Fit and Holm-Bonferroni F-tests to control Type I errors.
  - Developed Multiple Linear Regression model (R-squared 0.6592 and RMSE 4.38) with residual diagnostics.
  - Deployed an interactive **Dash** app with comprehensive explanations, detailed visuals, and predictions.

- [**Outlier Detection and De-noising for Audio-Based Neural Network Language Classification**](https://github.com/Stochastic1017/Speech-Enhancement_De-Noising)
  - Developed an ensemble outlier detector using Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor in **Scikit-Learn**.
  - Designed a speech detection and spectral gating algorithm with **Librosa** and **NoiseReduce** for noise suppression.
  - Processed 1320 parallel jobs for anomaly detection and de-noising using **Linux Bash** and **HTCondor**.
  - Trained a preliminary CNN on a random sample in TensorFlow, improving test accuracy by 2% and AUC by 4%.
  
- [**Finding Lyman Break Galaxy cB58 Resemblances Using High-Throughput Computing**](https://github.com/Stochastic1017/Identifying-cB58-Lyman-Break-Twins)
    - Identified noisy spectra matching Lyman Break Galaxy cB58 from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) datasets.
    - Computed similarity between spectra using distance metrics implemented in **R**.
    - Processed 2459 parallel jobs over 281 GB data using **Linux Bash** and **HTCondor**.

- [**Supervised machine learning model to predict gender based on first names**](https://github.com/Stochastic1017/Predicting-Gender)
    - Performed feature pre-processing and one-hot alphabet encoding using **NumPy** and **Pandas**.
    - Implemented an ensemble gradient boosting model with fine-tuned hyper-parameters using **Scikit-Learn**.
    - Achieved approximately 80% in accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC metrics.
